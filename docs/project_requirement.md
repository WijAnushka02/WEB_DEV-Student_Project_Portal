# Student Project Showcase Portal

## Scenario

The Faculty of Computing requires a web application where students can showcase their academic and personal projects while recruiters can browse and discover talented students.

The system should support three types of users:

- **Students**
  - Login using Google OAuth
  - Create, edit, and delete project posts
  - Upload a project thumbnail/image
  - View projects created by other students

- **Recruiters**
  - Browse projects
  - Like projects
  - Follow students

- **Admin**
  - View all users and projects
  - Remove inappropriate projects

---

# Functional Requirements

## 1. Authentication (Google OAuth)

Users must authenticate using **Google OAuth**.

### Required User Information
- Name
- Email
- Profile Picture

Store all user details in the database.

---

## 2. Project Management (Request / Response)

Students should be able to:

- Create a project
- Update a project
- Delete a project
- View all projects
- View a single project

### Example REST APIs

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/projects` | Create a new project |
| GET | `/projects` | Get all projects |
| GET | `/projects/:id` | Get project by ID |
| PUT | `/projects/:id` | Update a project |
| DELETE | `/projects/:id` | Delete a project |

---

## 3. Event-Driven Component

Generate events whenever:

- A project is created
- A project receives a like

### Example Events

- `ProjectCreated`
- `ProjectLiked`

These events should trigger one of the following:

- Notification creation
- Activity log entry

### Example Notification

```
John liked your project.
```

Students may implement this using:

- EventEmitter
- Simple Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Pattern

---

## 4. Notifications

Display notifications generated only through events.

### Examples

- Mary liked your project.
- Alex started following you.

Notifications **must not** be created directly from controllers. They should only be generated through the event system.

---

## 5. Database

Suggested database tables:

- users
- projects
- likes
- followers
- notifications

---
